# RecipeBook

## About
This project's purpose is better understand AngularJS 2. Features include being able to see a list of recipes that have a title and description, image url, and ingredients with a seperate field for quantity of ingredients. 
Recipes can be deleted and edited. From ingredients, you can transfer to a shopping list to be able to view all ingredients.

### Techstack
- AngularJS 
- Typescript
- HTML 
- CSS (More to be added)
- Firebase

## Bugs noticed
- Unable to actually store items but will store in JSON firebase data, can be retreived.
- When adding ingredients to a new recipe, the ingredient and quanity does not disappear as expected
- In order to access the correct shopping list for recipe, must press shopping list on recipe then press shopplist on navbar
- NOT mobile friendly

## Features I want to add 
- Being able to upload your own image rather than pull an image url
- Create/sign up users, Authentication for users
- Instead of adding just quanity for ingredients, I would like to add a list of metrics available (lb, oz., etc.)
- OVERALL: create a better intuitive design and make it mobile friendly
